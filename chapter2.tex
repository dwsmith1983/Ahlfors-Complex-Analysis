\subsection{Analytic Functions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  If \(g(w)\) and \(f(z)\) are analytic functions, show that \(g(f(z))\) is
  also analytic.
  
\item
  Verify Cauchy-Riemann's equations for the function \(z^2\) and \(z^3\).
  \par\smallskip
  Let \(z = x + iy\).
  Then \(z^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2xyi\) and
  \(z^3 = x^3 - 3xy^2 + i(3x^2y - y^3)\).
  For \(f(z) = z^2\), the Cauchy-Riemann equations are
  \begin{gather*}
    u_x = 2x \qquad v_y = 2x\\
    u_y = -2y \qquad -v_x = -2y
  \end{gather*}
  Thus, the Cauchy-Riemann equation satisfied for \(f(z) = z^2\).
  For \(f(z) = z^3\), the Cauchy-Riemann equations are
  \begin{gather*}
    u_x = 3x^2 - 3y^2 \qquad v_y = 3x^2 - 3y^2\\
    u_y = -6xy \qquad -v_x = -6xy
  \end{gather*}
  Thus, the Cauchy-Riemann equation satisfied for \(f(z) = z^3\).
\item
  Find the most general harmonic polynomial of the form
  \(ax^3 + bx^2y + cxy^2 + dy^3\).
  Determine the conjugate harmonic function and the corresponding analytic
  function by integration and by the formal method.
  \par\smallskip
  In order to be harmonic, \(u(x,y) = ax^3 + bx^2y + cxy^2 + dy^3\) has to
  satisfy \(\nabla^2u = 0\) so
  \[
  u_{xx} + u_{yy} = (3a + c)x + (3d + b)y = 0.
  \]
  Thus, \(3a = -c\) and \(3d = -b\) so
  \[
  u(x,y) = ax^3 - 3axy^2 - 3dx^2y + dy^3.
  \]
  To find the harmonic conjugate \(v(x,y\), we need to look at the
  Cauchy-Riemann equations.
  By the Cauchy-Riemann equations,
  \[
  u_x = 3ax^2 - 3ay^2 - 6dxy = v_y.
  \]
  Then we can integrate with respect to \(y\) to find \(v(x,y)\).
  \[
  v(x,y) = \int(3ax^2 - 3ay^2 - 6dxy)dy = 3ax^2y - ay^3 - 3dxy^2 + g(x)
  \]
  Using the second Cauchy-Riemann, we have
  \[
  v_x = 6axy - 3dy^2 + g'(x) = -u_y = 3dx^2 + 6axy - 3dy^2
  \]
  so \(g'(x) = 3dx^2\).
  Then \(g(x) = dx^3 + C\) and
  \[
  v(x,y) = 3ax^2y - ay^3 - 3dxy^2 + dx^3 + C.
  \]
\item
  Show that an analytic function cannot have a constant absolute value without
  reducing to a constant.
  \par\smallskip
  Let \(f = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)\).
  Then the modulus of \(f\) is \(\lvert f\rvert = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2}\).
  If the modulus of \(f\) is constant, then \(u^2 + v^2 = c\) for some constant
  \(c\).
  If \(c = 0\), then \(f = 0\) which is constant.
  Suppose \(c\neq 0\).
  By taking the derivative with respect to \(x\) and \(y\), we have
  \begin{align*}
    0 & = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(u^2 + v^2)\\
      & = 2uu_x + 2vv_x\\
      & = uu_x + vv_x\\
    0 & = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(u^2 + v^2)\\
      & = uu_y + vv_y
  \end{align*}
  Since \(f\) is analytic, \(f\) satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann.
  That is, \(u_x = v_y\) and \(u_y = -v_x\).
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
      uv_y + vv_x & = 0\label{2.1.2.4a}\\
      -uv_x + vv_y & = 0\label{2.1.2.4b}
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
  Setting \cref{2.1.2.4a} equal to \cref{2.1.2.4b}, we have
  \[
  v_x(u + v) + v_y(u - v) = 0.
  \]
  Now, either \(v_x\) and \(v_y\) are zero, \(v_x\) and \(u - v\) are zero,
  \(v_y\) and \(u + v\) are zero, or \(u + v\) and \(u - v\) are zero.
  If \(v_x = v_y = 0\), then \(f\) is constant.
  If \(v_x = 0\) and \(u - v = 0\), then \(u_y = 0\) and \(u = v\).
  Since \(u = v\) and \(v_x = 0\), then so does \(u_x = 0\) and it also follows
  that \(v_y = 0\); thus, \(f\) is a constant.
  By the same argument, \(f\) is a constant when \(v_y = 0\) and \(u + v = 0\).
  If \(u + v = 0\) and \(u - v = 0\), then \(u = \pm v\) so \(u = v = 0\) and
  \(f\) is a constant.
\item
  Prove rigorously that the functions \(f(z)\) and \(\overline{f(\bar{z})}\)
  are simultaneously analytic.
\item
  Prove that the functions \(u(z)\) and \(u(\bar{z})\) are simultaneously
  harmonic.
\item
  Show that a harmonic function satisfies the formal differential equation
  \[
  \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial z\partial\bar{z}} = 0.
  \]
